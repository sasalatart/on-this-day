- **Sample Call:**
  ```javascript
  $.ajax({
    url: "api/episodes?type=deaths&day=17&month=6",
    dataType: "json",
    type : "GET",
    success : function(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }
  });
  ```

#### About Short Mode

If the `short` query string is supplied, no keywords (`kw`) will be returned in the response.

## Setup

#### Development

1. Clone and cd into this repository
2. run `yarn install`
3. Export the environment variables `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` (27017 by default), or alternatively `MONGODB_URI`.
4. Turn on your local mongodb server if that is the case.
5. run `nodemon src/server` (turns on the backend server)
6. run `yarn run start-dev` (turns on the frontend development server)

#### Docker for production deployment

```sh
# Start database and app server via docker-compose
$ docker-compose up -d

# Setup the database
$ docker exec on_this_day npm run seed

# Stop docker containers:
$ docker-compose stop
```

Now the app should be available on port 9000:  `curl http://127.0.0.1:9000`

The app can be mapped to a different port in `docker-compose.yml` file

#### Starting docker on system-startup

We'll use systemd to launch docker-compose in detached mode, let's create service file in `/etc/systemd/system/onthisday.service` with contents:

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Docker Compose Application Service for on_this_day
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
WorkingDirectory=/change/this/to/project/directory
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose down
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Be sure to change the WorkingDirectory to where you cloned this repository.

Now let's enable the service: `systemctl enable onthisday`

Restart the machine to make sure it will bring up the containers on system startup
